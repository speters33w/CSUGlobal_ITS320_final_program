#### Option #2: **Program Corrections, Lessons Learned, and Home Inventory Program**

Your portfolio project consists of three components:

1. Program corrections
2. Lessons learned reflection
3. Final program

**Assignment Instructions**
**Program corrections**:

- Make appropriate corrections to all the programming assignments submitted as Critical Thinking Assignments from Modules 1-6.
- Submit the programs along with a carefully outlined description of corrections made in order for programs to run correctly.

**Lessons learned reflection**:

- Create a two- or three-page summary that outlines the lessons learned in this Basic Programming course.

**Final program**:

- Create a home inventory class that will be used by a National  Builder to maintain inventory of available houses in the country. The  following attributes should be present in your home class:
- private int squarefeet
- private string address
- private string city
- private string state
- private int zipcode
- private string Modelname
- private string salestatus (sold, available, under contract)

Your program should have appropriate methods such as:

- constructor
- add a new home
- remove a home
- update home attributes
- At the end of your program, be sure that it allows the user to output all home inventory to a text file.
- Be sure that your final program includes your source code and  screenshots of the application, executing the application, and the  results.
